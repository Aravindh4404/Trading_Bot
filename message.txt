On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone. [ 516 ] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.

[ 147 ] : 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

      "content": "the company described as \"production hell\". [ 51 ] [ 52 ] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] This period of \"production hell\" put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC , which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 . [ 57 ] During 2020, its share price increased 740%, [ 58 ] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined, [ 59 ] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US. [ 60 ] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020; [ 61 ] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV , based on the Model 3. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Deliveries started in March 2020. [ 65 ] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture). [ 66 ] The factory's first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out in December, less than one year after groundbreaking. [ 67 ] Gigafactory Berlin broke ground in February 2020, [ 68 ] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022. [ 69 ] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020, [ 70 ] and its production of the Model Y began in April 2022. [ 71 ] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025, [ 72 ] but its groundbreaking has been delayed. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic , Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions. [ 73 ] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020. [ 74 ] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit. [ 75 ] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years",

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California , from Toyota for $42 million. [ 31 ] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ , the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956. [ 32 ] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million. [ 33 ] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S. [ 34 ] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012, the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan. [ 35 ] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year , [ 36 ] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013. [ 37 ] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016. [ 38 ] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company. [ 39 ] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot , a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\". [ 40 ] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015. [ 41 ] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling. [ 42 ] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X , in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity , in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal. [ 45 ] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary. [ 46 ] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed. [ 47 ] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business. [ 48 ] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week, the company received over 325,000 paid reservations. [ 49 ] To speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles. [ 50 ] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell\". [",
